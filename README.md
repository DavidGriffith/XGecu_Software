# XGecu_Software
This is a mirror of current and archival versions of software for XGecu's (formerly Autoelectric's) chip programmers, both to make older versions available if needed, as well as to provide a source which is somewhat faster than the official site.  The set of programmers currently supported by the software here includes the TL886A, the TL866CS, the TL866II Plus, the T56, and the T48.

Note that this archive is missing many versions of the TL866A/TL866CS software (minipro_setupXXX.rar).  If anybody has copies of missing versions, please submit them.
